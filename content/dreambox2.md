### MOBILE ORGANIZATION

Change location of crafts if you need room for something else -- part of my office vs in dedicated sewing room. Can be put in living room, kitchen

Can be used for more than crafts: Paper crafts, art supplies, sewing, yarn home or virtual school, command center, home business, Lego collection, baking supplies, Warhammer...etc

### CUSTOMIZABLE

Shelves can be put anywhere, order more shelves if needed

Totes can be moved easily with the new tote track system

80 vs 40 tote package

Can change the whole look by adding liners to the clear totes

### Other Create Room FURNITURE and ACCESSORIES

SEW STATION (42.5” x 23.5”) make a video

Reasons I bought:

Recessed sewing machine, my back and neck needed lower -Sew steady inset

Back table leaf and side table leaf for more room when quilting. Can add side table to left or right side.

Electric Lift – can put machine up and down or put away and have a small cabinet in room

Spool holder- l love having easy access to my thread!

On caster wheels so I can move my sewing table where I need it.

Use it with my Dream Box table

2 notion totes, 2 shoe box, 3 shelves

Needed to add corner protectors

DREAM CART (69.5’ x 28.5” ) we’ll see how I like it

Customizable shelves (7) and clear totes

Added storage

2 leaves 25.5” x 28.5” each

on caster wheels

SIDE TABLES

I like having extra table space for my big projects.

Pros: more space/ standing or sitting heights.

Cons: takes up room in your box for tracks to insert table

Heavy/ need to store when not in use

PAPER ORGANIZER: was given by CR

Love the way it looks and can customize it for stamp pads, vinyl rolls etc.

8 SHALLOW TOTES

Love the way I can micro organize

TOOL CUBBY can use for stamp pads or other things

CRAFTER’S CADDY

I love having a trash can connected to my table and a place to hold my drink. I had one for both boxes and found I needed 2 since I go form craft to craft.

CUTTING MAT

Fits table exactly. Works well, but I like the look of other mats better

TOTE LIDS – I like for storing under the table or in the closet. Otherwise, I like not having to take the lids off.

Love them for carrying to a class

PLASTIC NOTION TRAY great for more organization

POWER PACKAGE

Power Up! – love that it can attach to wall with clips, it I small and has place I can charge my iPad

Upper Hand – use for watching a tutorial when I need the table space. Use it more for taking a video or picture

Boom Baby – don’t use like I thought I would.
