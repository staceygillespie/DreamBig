### [SEW STATION](https://www.createroom.com/collections/furniture/products/sew-station?ref=YJvA8 "Sew") {#sew-station}

<b>Use the code <span style="color:#bf6667;font-size:xx-large;">DREAMBIGSEW</span> to save $50 <span style="font-size:small;"></span></b>

Reasons I bought my Sew Station:

* Recessed sewing machine: my back and neck needed it lower!
* Comes with Sew Steady acrylic inset made for my machine
* Back and side table leaves can be extended for more room when quilting
* Add side table to left or right side -- I prefer the left
* Electric Lift â€“ moves my machine up to sew / down to stow
* Turns it into small cabinet
* Spool holder- easy access to my thread!
* On caster wheels so I can move my sewing table where I need it
* Connects to my DreamBox table so I have extra table space when I quilt
* 2 notion totes, 2 shoe box, 3 shelves
