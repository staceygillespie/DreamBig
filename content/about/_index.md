I am a creativity entrepreneur dedicated to bringing the joy of art to others. I have devoted my life to discovering new art forms and teaching that anyone can find peace and happiness through creative expression.

After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I discovered that art is also therapy, which has helped me and countless others cope with and overcome physical, mental and emotional pain.

I am a mother and grandmother. After moving all over the world as a military spouse, my family and I have finally put down roots in Davis County, Utah.
