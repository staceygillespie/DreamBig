## Why I Love My DreamBox

Check out the NEW Products [Here](/current-deals/ "Deal page").

### MOBILE ORGANIZATION

* With your supplies in one mobile cabinet you can move them to a new location, if needed --to the living room, kitchen, a spare room, the garage or your basement.
* Mine are in part of my office and also in my dedicated sewing room (I love having 2!)
* Use it for whatever is your passion: Paper crafts, art, sewing, yarn, home / virtual school, as a command center, home business, for your Lego collection, baking supplies, Warhammer...etc.

### CUSTOMIZABLE - the main reason I bought mine

* Shelves can be placed and spaced in ANY configuration you need
* Totes can be moved easily with the new tote track system
* Comes with a 40 tote package that can be expanded to 80
* Change the whole look by adding liners to the clear totes

### CLEAR TOTES

* I love being able to quickly see everything I have
* Totes made out of strong and sturdy material
* Can accommodate 12 x 12 paper, watercolor pads, vinyl, etc.
* I love to use them as Project totes -- everything for one project in one place
* Dream Box comes with 40 totes -- upgradable to 80

![](/images/gillespie-stacey4-27-21-25.jpg)

* Using liners to customize the look is very popular

See how Anna personalized her totes with fun liners -- and did you notice her DreamBox is in her bedroom? It can go almost anywhere.

Renee decorated her totes and also used the new [wallpaper](https://www.createroom.com/pages/wallpaper-detail?ref=JvA8) on her DreamBox.

* Store them in other places - swap them in and out

### EVERYTHING AT ARMS REACH right where I'm working

* I can easily get started in my creative pursuit and it's easy to clean up!
* I know what I have and I don’t double buy

### NO MORE SEARCHING

* Through bins and closets for supplies or in multiple rooms
* The whole family knows where to find the tape or scissors..etc.

### LARGE TABLE

* 2’11.5D x 2’10.75 W
* Accommodates 2 people comfortably - or 3 (me and 2 grandkids!)
* My own dedicated table vs kitchen table or counter
* 3 desks – sitting, standing, drafting

### DEDICATED SPACE for my CRICUT

I keep it at back of the table and can easily to pull it out to use

### CROWN and LIGHT (add on)

* Light shines on the table where I need it
* LED natural daylight = true colors
* I like the way the crown completes the look of my DreamBox
* Great for watercolor painting during day, vital for creating anything at night

* Add side table to left or right side -- I prefer the left
* Electric Lift – moves my machine up to sew / down to stow
* Turns it into small cabinet
* Spool holder - easy access to my thread!
* On caster wheels so I can move my sewing table where I need it
* Connects to my DreamBox table so I have extra table space when I quilt
* 2 notion totes, 2 shoebox totes, 3 shelves

My [DreamCart](https://www.createroom.com/products/dream-cart "DreamCart") looks so cute when I decorated the bins!

I love using my DreamCart as extra table space when people come to watercolor with me. I can put it in front of the TV or use it in front of our computer when we are following a tutorial.  It also makes a handy table for playing games!

***

### [SIDE TABLES](https://www.createroom.com/collections/accessories/products/side-tables?variant=19872388055102?ref=YJvA8 "Side Tables") {#side-tables}

* I love having extra table space for my big projects
* Pros:
  * More space
  * Use them at both standing or sitting heights
* Cons:
  * Track to insert table uses up space in DreamBox
  * Tables are heavy and need a storage place when not in use

![](/images/gillespie-stacey4-27-21-32.jpg)

I have both side tables and love using both.

## ![](/images/2020-dreambox-may-14-9-3.jpg)

***

* I love them when taking totes to a class or get together
* They are great for stacking totes
* However I prefer not to use lids when totes are in my DreamBox

![](/images/totelidslaunch-0406.jpeg)

* Lids make stacking totes for storage easy -- under the table, in the closet

## ![](/images/gillespie-stacey4-27-21-71.jpg)

***

### [PLASTIC NOTION TRAY](https://www.createroom.com/collections/inview-totes/products/plastic-notions-tray-inserts?_pos=2&_sid=708725df2&_ss=r?ref=YJvA8 "Notion Tray")

###### ** I am an affiliate for Create Room.  I started this journey as a very happy customer who loves their products.  I purchased both of my [DreamBoxes](https://www.createroom.com/products/dreambox?ref=YJvA8 "DreamBox"), my [Sew Station](https://www.createroom.com/collections/furniture/products/sew-station?ref=YJvA8 "Sew Station") and my [DreamCart](https://www.createroom.com/collections/furniture/products/dream-cart?ref=YJvA8 "Dream Cart") myself.

I will always be honest about what I like about these products and anything else I talk about on my website.
