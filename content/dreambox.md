## Why I Love My [DreamBox](https://www.createroom.com/?ref=YJvA8 "DreamBox")

### MOBILE ORGANIZATION

* With your supplies in one mobile cabinet you can move them to a new location, if needed --to the living room, kitchen, a spare room, the garage or your basement.
* Mine are in part of my office and also in my dedicated sewing room (I love having 2!)
* Use it for whatever is your passion: Paper crafts, art, sewing, yarn, home / virtual school, as a command center, home business, for your Lego collection, baking supplies, Warhammer...etc.

### CUSTOMIZABLE - the main reason I bought mine

* Shelves can be placed and spaced in ANY configuration you need
* Totes can be moved easily with the new tote track system
* Comes with a 40 tote package that can be expanded to 80
* Change the whole look by adding liners to the clear totes

### CLEAR TOTES

* I love being able to quickly see everything I have
* Totes made out of strong and sturdy material
* Can accommodate 12 x 12 paper, watercolor pads, vinyl, etc.
* I love to use them as Project totes -- everything for one project in one place
* Dream Box comes with 40 totes -- upgradable to 80

* Using liners to customize the look is very popular

See how Anna personalized her totes with fun liners -- and did you notice her DreamBox is in her bedroom? It can go almost anywhere.

* Store them in other places - swap them in and out

### EVERYTHING AT ARMS REACH right where I'm working

* I can easily get started in my creative pursuit and it's easy to clean up!
* I know what I have and I don’t double buy

### NO MORE SEARCHING

* Through bins and closets for supplies or in multiple rooms
* The whole family knows where to find the tape or scissors..etc.

### LARGE TABLE

* 2’11.5D x 2’10.75 W
* Accommodates 2 people comfortably - or 3 (me and 2 grandkids!)
* My own dedicated table vs kitchen table or counter
* 3 desks – sitting, standing, drafting

### DEDICATED SPACE for my CRICUT

I keep it at back of the table and can easily to pull it out to use

### CROWN and LIGHT (add on)

* Light shines on the table where I need it
* LED natural daylight = true colors
* I like the way the crown completes the look of my DreamBox
* Great for watercolor painting during day, vital for creating anything at night

### [SIDE TABLES](https://www.createroom.com/collections/accessories/products/side-tables?variant=19872388055102?ref=YJvA8 "Side Tables") {#side-tables}

* I love having extra table space for my big projects
* Pros:
  * More space
  * Use them at both standing or sitting heights
* Cons:
  * Track to insert table uses up space in DreamBox
  * Tables are heavy and need a storage place when not in use

![](/images/gillespie-stacey4-27-21-32.jpg)

I have both side tables and love using both.

* I love them when taking totes to a class or get together
* They are great for stacking totes
* However I prefer not to use lids when totes are in my DreamBox

![](/images/totelidslaunch-0406.jpeg)

* Lids make stacking totes for storage easy -- under the table, in the closet

###### ** I am an affiliate for Create Room.  I started this journey as a very happy customer who loves their products.  I purchased both of my [DreamBoxes](https://www.createroom.com/products/dreambox?ref=YJvA8 "DreamBox"), my [Sew Station](https://www.createroom.com/collections/furniture/products/sew-station?ref=YJvA8 "Sew Station") and my [DreamCart](https://www.createroom.com/collections/furniture/products/dream-cart?ref=YJvA8 "Dream Cart") myself.  Create Room did not give them to me, but they do compensate me every time you use one of my codes or buy through one of my links.  I will always be honest about what I like about these products and anything else I talk about on my website.
