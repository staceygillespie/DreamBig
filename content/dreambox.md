## Why I Love My [DreamBox](https://www.createroom.com/?ref=YJvA8 "DreamBox")

![](/images/dreambox-open.jpg)

### MOBILE ORGANIZATION

* With your crafts in one mobile cabinet you can move them to a new location if needed -- living room, kitchen, etc.
* Mine are in part of my office and also in a dedicated sewing room
* Use it for whatever is your passion: Paper crafts, art, sewing, yarn, home / virtual school, command center, home business, Lego collection, baking supplies, Warhammer...etc

### CUSTOMIZABLE

* Shelves can be placed and spaced in any configuration you need
* Totes can be moved easily with the new tote track system
* 40 tote package expandable to 80
* Change the whole look by adding liners to the clear totes

### CLEAR TOTES

* I love being able to quickly see everything I have
* Totes made out of strong and sturdy material
* Can accommodate 12 x 12 paper, watercolor pads, vinyl, etc.
* Using liners to customize the look is very popular
* Project totes!  For storing projects in progress
* Store them in other places - swap them in and out
* Dream Box comes with 40 totes -- upgradable to 80

### EVERYTHING AT ARMS REACH

* Easy to get started!  Easy to clean up!
* When I know what I have I don’t double buy

### NO MORE SEARCHING

* Through bins and closets for SUPPLIES

### LARGE TABLE

* 2’11.5D x 2’10.75 W
* Accommodates 2 people comfortably - or 3 (me and 2 grandkids!)
* My own dedicated table vs kitchen table or counter
* 3 desks – sitting, standing, drafting

### DEDICATED SPACE for my CRICUT

Located at back of the table; easy to pull out and use

### CROWN and LIGHT (add on)

* Light shines on the table where I need it
* LED natural daylight = true colors
* I like the way the crown makes my DreamBox look
* Great for watercolor painting during day, vital for anything at night

## Other Create Room                    FURNITURE and ACCESSORIES

### SEW STATION

* Reasons I bought:
* Recessed sewing machine: my back and neck needed lower
* Comes with Sew Steady acrylic inset
* Back table leaf and side table leaf for more room when quilting. Can add side table to left or right side.
* Electric Lift – moves machine up to sew / down to stow - turns it into small cabinet
* Spool holder- l love having easy access to my thread!
* On caster wheels so I can move my sewing table where I need it
* Use it with my DreamBox table
* 2 notion totes, 2 shoe box, 3 shelves

### DREAM CART

* Customizable shelves (7) and clear totes
* Added storage
* 2 leaves 25.5” x 28.5” each
* On caster wheels

### SIDE TABLES

* I like having extra table space for my big projects
* Pros: more space/ standing or sitting heights.
* Cons: takes up room in your box for tracks to insert table
* Heavy/ need place to store when not in use

### PAPER ORGANIZER

* Love the way it looks
* Can customize it for stamp pads, vinyl rolls etc.

### 8 SHALLOW TOTES

* Love the way these let me micro organize

### TOOL CUBBY

*  can use for stamp pads or other items

### CRAFTER’S CADDY

* I love having a trash can connected to my table and a place to hold my drink
* Used to share one for both boxes and found I needed 2

### CUTTING MAT

* Fits table exactly and works well
* But I like the look of other mats better

### TOTE LIDS

* These are useful when storing totes under the table or in the closet
* I also love them for carrying to a class
* Otherwise I prefer not to use lids

### PLASTIC NOTION TRAY

* great for more organization

### POWER PACKAGE

**Power Up!** – love that:

*  it can attach to side of DreamBox with included clips
* it is small
* Two USB ports to charge my iPad and phone

**Upper Hand** 

* I use this to watch tutorials when I need the table space
* I use it more for taking a video or picture

**Boom Baby** – I haven't used this like I thought I would
