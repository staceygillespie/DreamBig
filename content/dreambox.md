## Why I Love My [DreamBox](https://www.createroom.com/?ref=YJvA8 "DreamBox")

![](/images/dreambox-open.jpg)

### MOBILE ORGANIZATION

* With your supplies in one mobile cabinet you can move them to a new location, if needed --to the living room, kitchen, a spare room, the garage or your basement.
* Mine are in part of my office and also in my dedicated sewing room (I love having 2!)
* Use it for whatever is your passion: Paper crafts, art, sewing, yarn, home / virtual school, as a command center, home business, for your Lego collection, baking supplies, Warhammer...etc.

### CUSTOMIZABLE (the main reason I bought mine)

* Shelves can be placed and spaced in ANY configuration you need
* Totes can be moved easily with the new tote track system
* Comes with a 40 tote package that can be expanded to 80
* Change the whole look by adding liners to the clear totes

### CLEAR TOTES

* I love being able to quickly see everything I have
* Totes made out of strong and sturdy material
* Can accommodate 12 x 12 paper, watercolor pads, vinyl, etc.
* Using liners to customize the look is very popular
* Project totes!  For storing projects in progress
* Store them in other places - swap them in and out
* Dream Box comes with 40 totes -- upgradable to 80

### EVERYTHING AT ARMS REACH right where I'm working

* I can easily get started in my creative pursuit and it's easy to clean up!
* I know what I have I don’t double buy

### NO MORE SEARCHING

* Through bins and closets for supplies or in multiple rooms
* The whole family knows where to find the tape or scissors..etc.

### LARGE TABLE

* 2’11.5D x 2’10.75 W
* Accommodates 2 people comfortably - or 3 (me and 2 grandkids!)
* My own dedicated table vs kitchen table or counter
* 3 desks – sitting, standing, drafting

### DEDICATED SPACE for my CRICUT

Located at back of the table; easy to pull out and use

### CROWN and LIGHT (add on)

* Light shines on the table where I need it
* LED natural daylight = true colors
* I like the way the crown completes the look of my [DreamBox](https://www.createroom.com/?ref=YJvA8 "US link")
* Great for watercolor painting during day, vital for anything at night

* Pros: more space/ standing or sitting heights.
* Cons: takes up room in your box for tracks to insert table
* Heavy/ need place to store when not in use
