### I love making things with paper, wood, vinyl, felt, and infusible ink.

See the brand [NEW Cricut machines](https://shrsl.com/30orw "new-machines-3") that are for sale!  They can cut 2 times faster and are able to cut with a mat when using [Smart material](https://shrsl.com/30osa "smart materials")s.

#### I love 3D paper projects like this Peony Gift Box I made using a cutting file from [Dreaming Tree](https://3dsvg.com/shop/boxes-svg-files/peony-gift-box-svg-silhouette-cameo-cricut-explore/ "Peony Gift Box").

I used [Cricu](https://shrsl.com/30jt6 "Cricut store sales")[t](https://shrsl.com/30jkf "Cricut home page") [cardstock](https://shrsl.com/30jl0 "cardstock") and [pearl](https://shrsl.com/30jky "pearl paper") paper to make this gift box for a friend.  I was able to use my Stampin' Up! inks to ink the edges of the flower. I was a Stampin' Up! demonstrator from 1999-2006.  I don't stamp much anymore, but I still love it!

#### I love Cricut's [infusible ink](https://shrsl.com/30dc0 "Infusible ink").

#### I made this mermaid pillow using infusible ink [transfer sheets](https://shrsl.com/30jnx "transfer sheets") and design space images for my grandson.  My sons all humored me by taking part in this 2019 Christmas break activity where we all designed our own [shirts](https://shrsl.com/30jkk "blank shirts").  Some of used infusible ink and some the [infusible ink pens](https://shrsl.com/30jl6 "infusible ink pens").  you can have your [Cricut](https://shrsl.com/30jkf "home") machine draw your image for you using their infusible ink pens!
