### I love making things with paper, wood, vinyl, felt, and infusible ink.  

##### I love 3D paper projects like this Peony Gift Box I made using a cutting file from [Dreaming Tree](https://3dsvg.com/shop/boxes-svg-files/peony-gift-box-svg-silhouette-cameo-cricut-explore/ "Peony Gift Box").

I used Cricut cardstock and pearl paper to make this gift box for a friend.  i was able to use my Stampin' Up! inks to ink the edges of the flower. I was a Stampin' Up! demonstrator form 1999-2006.  I don't stamp much anymore, but I still love it!
