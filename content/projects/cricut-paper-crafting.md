### I love 3D paper projects like this Peony Gift Box I made using a cutting file from [Dreaming Tree](https://3dsvg.com/shop/boxes-svg-files/peony-gift-box-svg-silhouette-cameo-cricut-explore/ "Peony Gift Box").

I used circuit pearl paper for the Peony and Cricut cardstock make this gift box.  I also inked the flower with my Stamping' Up! inks  I was a Stampin' Up! demonstrator from 1999-2006.  I don't stamp much anymore, but iIstill love it.
