Embroidering is fun!

</span></body>

I've been learning machine embroidery and this is my first BIG project.  I made this quilt for my Grandson and gave it to him for his first birthday.  The appliqu√©d animals are made from minky and it also has minky on the border and back of the quilt.

**My first Kimberbell Bench Pillow!**

I wanted to work on a quilt project with my sisters.  We decided to make this cute [Hoppy Easter Bench pillow](https://kimberbell.com/product/hoppy-easter-bench-pillow-machine-embroidery/).  You can buy this pattern at your local quilt shop or online.  You can get it in an Embroidery version or a sewing one.  My sisters used the sewing version since they don't have embroidery machines. We bought a fabric and embellishment kit [here](https://mygirlfriendsquiltshoppe.com/product/kimberbell-hoppy-easter-bench-pillow-kit/).

**My NEXT Bench Pillow in progress**

[May Flowers]()  You can get this in an Embroidery version or a sewing version.  Get them at your local quilt shop.  Some shops also have kits or you can find them online.  We choose our own fabric for this one.
