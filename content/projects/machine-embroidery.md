Embroidering is fun!

</span></body>

I've been learning machine embroidery and this is my first BIG project.  I made this quilt for my Grandson and gave it to him for his first birthday.  The appliqu√©d animals are made from minky and it also has minky on the border and back of the quilt.

**I took a** [**Kimberbell virtual event**](https://kimberbell.com/event-library/#two-day-events) **class and made this No Place Like Home pillow.**

I wanted to learn how to do the background quilting and to get tips on how to do more than basic machine embroidery so I took this class.

**My first Kimberbell Bench Pillow!**

I wanted to work on a quilt project with my sisters.  We decided to make this cute [Hoppy Easter Bench Pillow]().  You can get this in an Embroidery version or a sewing version.  You can get the patterns and kits at your local quilt shop.  We bought our kits [here](https://mygirlfriendsquiltshoppe.com/product/kimberbell-hoppy-easter-bench-pillow-kit/).  My sisters used the sewing version since they don't have embroidery machines.

**My NEXT Bench Pillow in progress**

[May Flowers]()  You can get this in an embroidery version or a sewing version.  Get them at your local quilt shop.  Some shops also have kits or you can find them online.  We choose our own fabric for this one.
