#### **My journey to learn to watercolor.**

![](/images/2020-dreambox-may-14-17.jpg)

I usually use [Sennelier](https://shrsl.com/30jli "Sennelier half pans") half pans (and their [tube paints](https://shrsl.com/30jlp "Sennelier tube paints") to refill them) as well as [Winsor and Newton](https://shrsl.com/30jlt "WN tube") tube paints.  I find that I get better results when I use the professional paints and paper.  When I am painting with friends and family we usually paint with Dandelion paints from [Let's Make Art](https://www.letsmakeart.com/products/dandelion-paint-co-15ml-watercolors "Dandelion Paints") since they are easy to share and is more economical.

I use [Princeton Heritage](https://shrsl.com/30jm1 "Princeton brushes") Series 4050 Synthetic Sable Brushes and [Arches](https://shrsl.com/30jm4 "Arches pad") Watercolor paper.  when we use Dandelion paints we use [Canson XL]() watercolor paper.

The first set I bought is the [Sennelier](https://shrsl.com/30jli "Sennelier half pan") Artist's Set of 12 + 6 FREE half pan set with metal case.  After watercolor painting for 2 years I have now purchased the Artists' Watercolor Set of 48 with metal case.

\**I am sharing some links of what I personally use and where you can buy them.  I bought my own supplies, but I get a little money when you use my links and buy from [Dick Blick](https://shrsl.com/30jmr "Home page").  I don't' get any compensation from [Let's Make Art](https://www.letsmakeart.com/pages/learn-watercolor "watercolor tutorials"), but I love Sarah's YouTube tutorials and have learned a lot from her teaching style.  I also feature other artist's tutorials I have followed and I am not compensated from any of these websites or artists.
