**Why do we limit ourselves and not go after our dreams?**

Often it's because we face seemingly unsurmountable barriers or we just don't believe in ourselves.

Many years ago when we were living in Italy with the military and I had 3 little boys under 5 I was getting constant migraines, extreme fatigue and dealt with a very painful neck.  I was feeling trapped by my body, but also troubled that it made it more difficult to take care of my sons and handle the challenges of military life in a foreign country.   I read an article that helped shape my perspective and enabled me see what I had to work with and not just the things that were limiting me.  [This article,](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1995/02/choices-and-challenges?lang=eng "Crayon story") written by Janet G. Lee, helped me realize that I could focus on the crayons I HAVE in my box and still make something beautiful in my life.  From this time forth I have had the motto: **_"There is beauty in this."_**  I have found that no matter the circumstance, you can always find a blessing in it: the lesson to learn or the actual beauty in the situation.  My life has not been easy.  I have had continual health challenges that have continued to worsen and now I face daily pain and debilitating dizziness with long bouts of vertigo - plus many other limitations due to MS.  I don't drive much anymore, so I am often isolated.  I have found that when I am **_creative_**; no matter the medium or endeavor it becomes a much need therapy to help me cope.  It also helps me focus on the **_beauty_** in life.  Because there is ALWAYS beauty to be found.

I'm grateful for a supportive husband who has, for years, put up with my mess when I craft or sew.  I tried to find an organizational system that works with my creative process for years.  Thankfully I found one.  I can contain that mess now that I have my [**DreamBox**](/dreambox/) (from Create Room) to keep my supplies at my fingertips and they can also be put away quickly -- and it looks nice!  I don't take up the whole kitchen counter or dining room table anymore.

I loved my first one so much that I bought a 2nd one!  I have one in our office, which is the first room you see when you walk in my front door, and my second [DreamBox](/dreambox/) in my sewing room where I have both a [DreamBox](/dreambox/) and a [Sew Station](/dreambox/#sew-station).

I love how you can have your DreamBox open when you need access to your materials, and closed when you want a more tidy look.
