I'm grateful for a supportive husband who has, for years, put up with my mess when I craft or sew.  Thankfully I can contain that mess now that I have my [**DreamBox**](https://www.dreambigwithstacey.com/dreambox/) (from Create Room) to keep my supplies at my fingertips and they can also be put away quickly -- and it looks nice!  I don't take up the whole kitchen counter or dining room table anymore.

I loved my first one so much that I bought a 2nd one!  I have one in our office, which is the first rom you see when you walk in my front door, and my second [DreamBox](https://www.dreambigwithstacey.com/dreambox/) in my sewing room where I have both a [DreamBox](https://www.dreambigwithstacey.com/dreambox/) and a [Sew Station](https://www.createroom.com/collections/furniture/products/sew-station?ref=YJvA8 "Sew Station link USA").

I love how you can have your DreamBox open when you need access to your materials, and closed when you want a more tidy look.
