I'm grateful for a supportive husband who has, for years, put up with my mess when I craft or sew.  Thankfully I can contain that mess now that I have my [**DreamBox**](/dreambox/) (from Create Room) to keep my supplies at my fingertips and they can also be put away quickly -- and it looks nice!  I don't take up the whole kitchen counter or dining room table anymore.

I loved my first one so much that I bought a 2nd one!  I have one in our office, which is the first rom you see when you walk in my front door, and my second [DreamBox](/dreambox/) in my sewing room where I have both a [DreamBox](/dreambox/) and a [Sew Station](/dreambox/#sew-station).

I love how you can have your DreamBox open when you need access to your materials, and closed when you want a more tidy look.
